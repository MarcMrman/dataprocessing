	<p class="explanation"> The gross domestic product is an economical measurefor all products and services produced in a certain matter of time. This measure includes inflation rates and the cost of living in a country. This economical measure is put up against the average hours worked in a year per person in that country. Using these two variables I created a ratio, to see which countries get most GDP out of one hour worked.</p>
