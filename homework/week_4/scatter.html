	<p class="explanation"> The gross domestic product is an economical measurefor all products and services produced in a certain matter of time. This measure includes inflation rates and the cost of living in a country. This economical measure is put up against the average hours worked in a year per person in that country. Using these two variables I created a ratio, to see which countries get most GDP out of one hour worked.</p>
	
	<!-- Here I have tried to create buttons to switch inbetween variables, Hours worked annually/Real minimum wage. However I did not succeed in creating the function to update my data so I commented the buttons out of my code. I wanted to make "value" decisive in what data would be shown in the function "makeScatter"  -->
